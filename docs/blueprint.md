- Background color: Light, desaturated blue (#EBF4FA), maintaining a consistent aesthetic without distracting from the content.
- Accent color: A muted purple (#9B59B6) for interactive elements and calls to action; this color complements the primary blue, while also offering a contrast to draw the user's attention.
- Clean and readable sans-serif font for body text to ensure readability on all devices.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for navigation and user actions.
- A clean, modern layout with ample white space to improve readability and focus.
- Subtle transition animations to acknowledge user input
